    <p>It is the largest virtual gathering to arrangement of physical human needs. There are a lot of organizations all around
    the globe who are doing a lot to help poor people. They are trying their best to provide each and every human soul of
    this planet with food and water. But there also comes the most unpredictable thing that is sickness. No matter if you
    are rich or poor, sickness is the one thing that can affect anyone’s and everyone’s health. And there is no stopping it
    because you cannot predict when or where sickness is going to get you. But one difference between sick people is their
    financials. The ones with a stable finance have a fighting chance against the sickness but for the poor, there is no
    escaping it. So, we are going to create a platform which will help the ordinary people in need of blood or plasma. Here,
    after sign in to our account we organize camps to donate blood and plasma as per demand. We check the nearby hospitals
    who are in dire need of blood or plasma and donate all the blood and plasma we gathered from the donation camps</p>
